This repository contains code written for my MATH 380 project in Fall 2021.

The purpose of the code is to find 'optimal' turn strategies in Fire Emblem.  This particular code base essentially just simulates a while bunch of games of FE and creates graphs out of them, so that we can try to find any patterns that arise.
